# Agent Prompt: Quirky Node.js Demo App

You are GitHub Copilot Agent. Using the Product Requirements in `docs/PRD.md`, scaffold a small Node.js application with the following:

- Initialize an npm project with ECMAScript modules.
- Install and configure Express.js.
- Create `app.js` exposing `GET /fact` that returns a random quirky animal fact in JSON.
- Add unit tests in `__tests__/app.test.js` using Jest.
- Generate a `README.md` with installation, usage, and test instructions.
- Commit each step with clear, descriptive commit messages.

Deliver code in discrete commits and await approval after each major step.
